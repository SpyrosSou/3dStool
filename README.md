# 3dStool
The 3D surgical tool dataset (3dStool) has been constructed with the aim of
assisting the development of computer vision techniques that address the
operating room.

Specifically, even though laparoscopic scenes have received a lot of attention
in terms of labelled images, surgical tools that are used at initial stages of
an operation, such as scalpels and scissors, have not had any such datasets
developed... until now.

3dStool includes 5370 images, accompanied by manually drawn polygon labels,
as well as information on the 3D pose of these tools in operation. Four
surgical tools have been collected for now:

1. Scalpel
2. Scissors
3. Forceps
4. Electric Burr

An example of the manual masks is shown below for each tool:

TODO:

1. Add images of masks, boxes, pose
2. Download link
3. Instructions of helper functions etc
4. Copy image handling functions from your project to folders
5. MY FACE IS IN THE PICTURES??????????
